            <p>
              Did you know that in Australia the jewellery industry is worth
              almost $3 billion annually? That's a lot of sparkles. If you're
              one of the many women who love to accessorise with jewellery, you
              know that the right piece can elevate any outfit and make you feel
              confident and stylish.

                Silver jewellery in particular is a timeless and versatile
                accessory that will add a touch of elegance and sophistication
                to your look. However, knowing how to style and care for your
                silver jewellery can be a challenge.

              A well-made piece of jewellery from a loved one can be a gift we
              wear every day, with emotional ties to the person from whom it
              came. Many are lucky enough to have pieces that have been passed
              down through generations. The right piece can pick us up when
              we’re down or can work like a protective shield; as though we
              carry our loved ones with us. <span class="dots">...</span>

                This year for Christmas we recommend making it meaningful; chose
                a gift that has a lot of thought behind it. Here are some
                choices we’ve put together, including pieces from our latest
                Australian Flora Range, inspired by stunning native flowers and
                plants.

              Did you know that people have been wearing earrings for thousands

                When deciding which earring types you should wear with which
                outfits it can be hard to choose. How do you know which type

                for stud earrings or hoops? What about drop earrings or long
                dangle earrings? Do you think you can get away with mismatched

            >
            <p>
              Do you know your ring size? Shopping for rings (especially online)
              can be a minefield if you don't know your size - and buying the
              wrong sized ring can be frustrating and possibly expensive. So how
              do you measure your ring size and feel confident that it's right?
              It can be tricky to figure out, so we're here to help.

              <span class="more-text" style="display: none">
                If you're purchasing an expensive or highly sentimental ring
                that you will be wearing every day, getting the size right is
                especially important because you don't want to risk losing it or
                finding it too tight to wear.
